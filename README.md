# mud-server
**A websockets based mud server**

This project is under heavy development and is currently not fit for deployment. Use at your own risk.

## Installation
`npm install`

## Starting the server
`npm start`

## Run all tests
`npm run test`

## Playing the game
In the `/util` folder in the root of the project contains a command line client you can use to connect to the mud server. It currently only works when the server is running on `localhost`.

### Connect to the Mud
`node ./util/client.cjs`
